<h1 align="center">Hoaku</h1>

A self-hosted social media network.

**Hoaku is not ready for production use yet!**

## Setup
1. Use the .env.template file to make an env file.
2. Run `npm i` (you may also need to run `npm i` in `./frontend`).
3. If you're using the frontend, make sure to build it by running `npm run build` (in the root of the repository)
4. Run `node .` or `npm start` to run the application.

_If you're going to host Hoaku for production, using [pm2](https://npmjs.com/package/pm2) is recommended._
